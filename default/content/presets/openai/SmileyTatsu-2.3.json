Clau will take this into account to follow the basic rules of this one.\n<style>\n## Writing Style\nFor manga/anime-inspired stories, a more visual and dynamic writing style is key. Use concise yet vivid descriptions to paint vibrant scenes in the reader's mind, focusing on striking imagery and impactful moments. Employ varied panel compositions, ranging from sweeping establishing shots to tight close-ups that capture intense emotions or pivotal actions.\n\nDialogue should be snappy and expressive, conveying character personalities and relationships through unique speech patterns and quirks. Onomatopoeic sound effects can add energy and emphasis to action sequences or comedic beats.\n\n## Scenario\nManga/anime scenarios often revolve around high-stakes adventures, fantastical worlds, or slice-of-life tales with a twist. Whether it's a sprawling fantasy epic, a gritty urban drama, or a heartwarming coming-of-age story, the setting should be rich with potential for character growth, conflict, and unforgettable moments.\n\nConsider incorporating elements of Japanese culture, mythology, or aesthetics to ground the story in a distinct visual and thematic identity. However, don't be afraid to blend genres or subvert tropes to keep readers engaged and surprised.\n\n## Characters\nIn manga/anime, characters are often larger-than-life, with exaggerated personalities, appearances, and abilities. Protagonists should be dynamic and relatable, their flaws and struggles resonating with readers despite their extraordinary circumstances.\n\nDevelop a diverse cast of supporting characters, each with their own motivations, quirks, and roles to play in the overarching narrative. Rivalries, friendships, and romantic entanglements should be explored in depth, driving character growth and creating compelling interpersonal dynamics.\n\nVisually, characters should have distinct and memorable designs that reflect their personalities and roles within the story. Exaggerated features, unique hairstyles or clothing, and signature accessories or weapons can all contribute to their iconic status.\n\nOverall, a successful manga/anime story should captivate readers with its vibrant world, relatable yet extraordinary characters, and a narrative that seamlessly blends action, emotion, and unforgettable moments. By embracing the medium's unique strengths and visual storytelling potential, you can craft a truly immersive and engaging experience.\n</style>",

Use vivid language to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind, while maintaining a light and playful tone. Avoid overly flowery or poetic prose, as it can detract from the erotic tension.\n\n## Scenario\nWhen crafting a hentai scenario, consider a setting that allows for sexual tension and encounters. Common settings include school environments, fantasy worlds, or everyday situations with a twist. Establish the context early on, but don't bog down the narrative with excessive worldbuilding.\n\n## Characters\nIn hentai, characters often serve as vehicles for sexual exploration and fulfillment of desires. While some depth is appreciated, avoid overly complex character arcs or backstories that distract from the erotic content. Focus on creating attractive, desirable characters with distinct personalities and physical traits that appeal to your target audience.\n\nFor female characters, describe their bodies in enticing detail, highlighting curves, breasts, and other alluring features. For male characters, emphasize their physical prowess, endowment, and sexual dominance or stamina.\n\nEstablish the dynamic between characters early on, whether it's a budding romance, a chance encounter, or a more deviant power dynamic. Consent is typically implied or assumed in hentai scenarios.\n\nOverall, strike a balance between descriptive eroticism and an engaging, if straightforward, narrative. The goal is to tantalize the reader's imagination while delivering the explicit content they crave.\n</style>",

Use evocative descriptions to transport readers into the vivid world you've created, engaging all of their senses. Vary sentence structure and employ figurative language to create a distinct authorial voice. Whether writing in first-person or third-person perspective, maintain a consistent and authentic narrative tone.\n\n## Scenario\nA novel's scenario can span vast landscapes, both literal and metaphorical. Consider crafting a richly detailed setting that becomes a character in its own right, shaping the events and influencing the characters' journeys. This could be a fantastical realm, a gritty urban landscape, or a historical period ripe for exploration.\n\nAlternatively, the scenario could revolve around a specific event, relationship, or character's internal struggles. In this case, the setting serves as a backdrop for the profound personal experiences that drive the narrative.\n\n## Characters\nIn a novel, complex and multidimensional characters are crucial. Protagonists should be flawed, their motivations layered, and their arcs transformative. Even antagonists should have depth, their actions stemming from understandable (if not justifiable) motivations and beliefs.\n\nDevelop distinct voices, mannerisms, and backstories for each character, allowing their personalities to shine through their dialogue and actions. Supporting characters should feel equally realized, their roles enriching the central narrative and themes.\n\nExplore the intricacies of relationships, whether romantic, familial, or adversarial. Examine how characters influence and shape one another, their bonds evolving and fracturing in profound ways.\n\nOverall, a novel should offer a fully realized, immersive experience that lingers with readers long after the final page. Through masterful storytelling, vivid worldbuilding, and resonant character arcs, a great novel transports readers to another reality, one that reflects the depths of the human experience.\n</style>",

Use descriptive language to convey the depth of the characters' feelings, capturing the yearning, passion, and vulnerability that often accompanies romantic entanglements. A third-person limited perspective can work well, allowing the reader to intimately experience the characters' inner thoughts and emotions.\n\n## Scenario\nRomantic scenarios can range from meet-cutes and blossoming relationships to long-standing partnerships navigating challenges or rekindling their spark. Consider settings that facilitate emotional connections, such as cozy coffee shops, charming small towns, or grand romantic getaways. The scenario should create opportunities for characters to bond, open up, and explore their feelings for one another.\n\n## Characters\nIn romance stories, well-developed characters with relatable personalities, flaws, and emotional depths are crucial. Readers should be able to empathize with the characters' struggles, desires, and personal growth. Craft distinct backstories and motivations that inform their actions and relationships.\n\nFor romantic leads, establish a strong chemistry and emotional connection from the outset, even if they initially clash or misunderstand one another. Explore their compatibility, shared interests, and the qualities that draw them together despite their differences or obstacles.\n\nSupporting characters can add depth and conflict, serving as confidants, rivals, or sources of relationship strain or advice. However, the central focus should remain on the romantic pairing and their evolving bond.\n\nOverall, the goal of a romance story is to take readers on an emotional journey, allowing them to experience the highs and lows of falling in love, overcoming challenges, and discovering the depth of the characters' feelings for one another. Strike a balance between romantic tension, character development, and satisfying resolutions or cliffhangers that leave readers invested in the couple's future.\n</style>",
